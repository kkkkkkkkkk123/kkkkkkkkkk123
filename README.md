 Hello, I'm Kang Fan ðŸ‘‹

## About Me

I'm Kang Fan, a dedicated Computer Science undergraduate at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC). I am deeply passionate about leveraging technology to solve real-world problems and am particularly interested in the fields of software engineering and data science. My academic journey is not just about gaining knowledge but also about applying what I learn to develop efficient and innovative solutions.

### Education

- **Bachelor of Science in Computer Science**
  - **University:** University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC)
  - **Year:** September 2023 - June 2025
  - **Focus:** Algorithms, Data Structures, Software Development
- **Associate in Computer Science**
  - **University:** Green River College
  - **Year:** September 2021 - June 2023
  - **Focus:** Algorithms, Data Structures

### Skills

### Projects

1. **Advanced Guessing Game (Data Structures Class)**
   - **Description:** Designed and implemented an interactive guessing game in Java that utilizes custom-built data structures to manage game states and user interactions efficiently.
   - **Highlights:** Developed a Question Tree and Node Tree to handle dynamic question-answer scenarios, enhancing the game's complexity and user engagement.
2. **Caesar Cipher Project (Data Structures Class)**
   - **Description:** This project features a simple implementation of the Caesar Cipher, a classic encryption technique used to secure messages by shifting letters of the alphabet by a predetermined number. This application provides both encryption and decryption functionalities accessible via a user-friendly command-line interface.
   - **Highlights:** Allows users to encrypt plaintext messages using a specified shift value, altering each letter based on the shift. Offers the ability to decrypt messages that were encrypted using the Caesar Cipher, using the same shift value that was used for encryption.
